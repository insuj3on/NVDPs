Neural Variational Dropout Processes
====================================

This repository implements the models and algorithms necessary to reproduce the experiments carried out in the paper
`Neural Variational Dropout Processes, Jeon et al. <https://openreview.net/forum?id=lyLVzukXi08> `

It includes code for running few-shot regression experiments with Gaussian Process with random kernel (learned variance), as well as for reproducing the 2d image inpainting (MNIST, CelebA, and Omniglot) experiments.

The main components of the repository are:
